- **2023-07-03 Welcome Reza**

[Mohammad Reza Farhadi-Nia](https://farhadinia.github.io/) is joining us for the summer to improve our FDTD code for coherent nonlinear microscopy.


- **2023-05-02 Paper accepted :)**

Another  paper from Jospehine's PhD work has been published: [we use FDTD to accurately reproduce experimental measurements of THG from tubular structures](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34528-7)  


- **2023-02-15 New dataset**

Looking for some nice raw datasets to test your STORM reconstruction algorithms ? I uploaded a bunch of old vectashield datasets (2D, 3D (astigmatism), low density, high density) to zenodo. See the new [dataset page](https://nolab.github.io/Webpage/dataset.html)

- **2023-01-05 Paper(s) accepted :)**

Vaky's preprint from May 2022 is now [published in a Peer-reviewed Journal](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.2c01249)

Hadjer's work from 2021 (with some significant help from Beatrice Durel, Manon  Raimbault & Audrey Laurent @ Necker in 2022) on testing Slowfade Diamond for STORM imaging has finally been published: [Evaluation of Slowfade Diamond as a buffer for STORM microscopy](https://opg.optica.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-14-2-550)

- **2022-12-22 New Preprint:**

[Spatial modeling of telomere intra-nuclear distribution reveals non-random organization that varies during cell cycle and depends on LAP2 and BAF](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.22.521599v1.abstract) Debora Keller, Sonia Stinus, David Umlauf, Edith Gourbeyre, Eric Biot, Nicolas Olivier, Pierre Mahou, Emmanuel Beaurepaire, Philippe Andrey & Laure Crabbe (bioRxiv)

 Goodbye Twitter, Welcome Mastodon !

 - **2022-05-20 New paper:**
  
 We present a new optimized buffer recipe for multicolor STORM imaging.  See [Vaky's preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.19.491818v1) for more details
