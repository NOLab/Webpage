# Master Projects
- **Rational optimization of STORM buffers based on photophysical parameters** 
Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) is a powerful method to achieve nanometer resolution in biological samples using a simple widefield optical microscope. It relies on inducing stochastic blinking in the fluorophores used to label the structure of interest by using chemical buffers that affect their photophysics. Our aim is to develop methods to improve super-resolved tissue imaging by focusing on the buffer composition. We recently made some good progress on mutilcolor imaging [1,2], and now aim at improving the achievable resolution for some fluorophores by further tuning this buffer, using both ensemble and single molecule experiments to extract photophysical parameters.

- **Extended Depth of Field for nonlinear and super-resolved microscopy**
When looking at sparse objects, or when quantifying the overall concentration of a protein, it is sometimes usefull to degrade the axial resolution of a microscope to image a larger volume at once. Achieving this without degrading the lateral resolution is possible, and we will consider different experimental approach that rely on the coherence of the excitation and detected light, first in the case of super-resolution microscopy and if time allows for nonlinear microscopy.

# PhD Project

- **Title: Modeling Coherent Nonlinear Microscopy (THG,SHG)**
- This project will be co-supervized by [Marie-Claire Schanne-Klein](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/lob/en/marie-claire-schanne-klein)
- Funding Options: No funding is guaranteed, so the students would be expected to apply to the IPP graduate school fellowships. PhD Track students are welcome: [www.ip-paris.fr/education/phd-track/phd-track-physique](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/phd-track/phd-track-physique)

Coherent nonlinear microscopy techniques such as Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) or Third-Harmonic Generation (THG) relies on the intrinsic nonlinear properties of biological tissues to provide 3D images of unstained biological tissues (such as skin, cornea, brain tissues or zebrafish embryo to name a few studied in the Lab). However this comes at a cost: coherent nonlinear methods have highly non-trivial contrast mechanisms, and current modeling approaches [3] cannot reproduce some experimental measurements, preventing accurate quantification of the images. We recently demonstrated a new approach for THG microscopy based on the Finite Difference time-domain method [4], and the goal of this PhD is to develop this method to apply it more broadly to other types of nonlinear microscopy, and to further improve the method by taking into account more complex optical properties such as non-diagonal tensor elements.
