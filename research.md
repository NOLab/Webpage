I have 2 main research interrests: Super resolution Microscpy and nonlinear microscopy

### Super-Resolution Miroscopy by Single Molecule Localization

Single Molecule Localization Microscopy is a powerfull method to achieve nanometer resolution in biological samples using a simple optical microscope. It relies on inducing stochastic blinking in the fluorophores used to label the structure of interest by using chemical buffers that affect their photophysics. Our aim is to develop methods to improve super-resolved tissue imaging by focusing on different tehcnical developments: 

## Multicolor Imaging
Although there has been steady progress in multiloro imaging since the inception of the method, it is still not straightforward to perfrom high quality multicolor 3D imaging. Our aim is to focus on the chemical buffers used to induce the stochastic blinking in order to achieve improve multicolor imaging.

## Tissue Imaging
Most single molecule imaging is done on cells grown on glass to be in perfect imaging conditions and maximize the signal-to noise ratio. We want to move to tissue imaging by  combining work on imaging buffers and dyes used, optical developments such as light-sheet illumination, and computational post-aquisition methods.

### Coherent Nonlinear Microscopy
Coherent nonlinear microscopy techniques such as Second harmonic generation (SHG) or Third-Harmonic generation (THG) provide 3D images of unstained biological tissues (such as skin, cornea, brain tissues or Zebrafish Embryo to name a few tissues studied at LOB), and be used on their own or to provide context to multiphoton excited fluorescence images of specific markers of interrest.
